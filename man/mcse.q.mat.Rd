\title{Apply \code{mcse.q} to each column of a matrix or data frame of MCMC samples}
\usage{
mcse.q.mat(x, q, size = NULL, g = NULL, method = c("bm", "obm", "sub"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix or data frame with each row being a draw from the multivariate distribution of
interest.}

\item{q}{the quantile of interest.}

\item{size}{the batch size. The default value is \dQuote{\code{sqroot}}, which uses the square
root of the sample size. \dQuote{\code{cuberoot}} will cause the function to use the cube root
of the sample size. A numeric value may be provided if \dQuote{\code{sqroot}} is not
satisfactory.}

\item{g}{a function such that the \eqn{q}th quantile of the univariate distribution function of
\eqn{g(x)} is the quantity of interest. The default is \code{NULL}, which causes the identity
function to be used.}

\item{method}{the method used to compute the standard error. This is one of \dQuote{\code{bm}}
(batch means, the default), \dQuote{\code{obm}} (overlapping batch means), or
\dQuote{\code{sub}} (subsampling bootstrap).}
}
\value{
\code{mcse.q.mat} returns a matrix with \code{ncol(x)} rows and two columns. The row
  names of the matrix are the same as the column names of \code{x}. The column names of the
  matrix are \dQuote{\code{est}} and \dQuote{\code{se}}. The \eqn{j}th row of the matrix contains
  the result of applying \code{mcse.q} to the \eqn{j}th column of \code{x}.
