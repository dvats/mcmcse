Description: Provides tools for computing Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSE) in
    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) settings. MCSE computation for expectation
	and quantile estimators is supported as well as multivariate estimations.
	The package also provides functions for computing effective sample size and
	for plotting Monte Carlo estimates versus sample size.
