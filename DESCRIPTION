Description: Provides tools for computing Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSE) in
    Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) settings (survey in <doi:10.1201/b10905>,
    Chapter 7). MCSE computation for expectation and quantile estimators is
    supported as well as multivariate estimations. The package also provides
    functions for computing effective sample size and for plotting Monte Carlo
    estimates versus sample size.
